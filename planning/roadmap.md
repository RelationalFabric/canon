# Canon Development Roadmap

Simple roadmap for building Canon's core features.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current - Q1 2025)

### âœ… Completed
- **Configuration Package**: TypeScript and ESLint configuration setup
- **Documentation Foundation**: Comprehensive docs (axioms, canons, examples)
- **Architecture Decision Records**: ADR methodology and templates
- **Technology Radar**: Complete radar system with 60 entries
- **Project Structure**: Package.json, build system, development tooling
- **Planning Framework**: Strategy, roadmap, and governance documentation

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Core Implementation**: Main package currently exports only `defu` utility
- **Type System**: No axiom or canon implementations yet
- **Utility Integration**: Dual export strategy documented but not implemented

### ðŸ“‹ Planned (Phase 1 Completion)
- **Core Axiom System**: Implement Id, Type, Version, Timestamps, References
- **Basic Canon Patterns**: Internal, JSON-LD, MongoDB implementations
- **Utility Library Integration**: type-fest, radash, jsonpath-plus
- **Dual Export Strategy**: Opinionated + transparent access patterns

## Phase 2: Ecosystem Integration (Q2 2025)

### Core Library Integration
**Priority: High**
