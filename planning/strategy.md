# Canon Strategic Vision

## Mission Statement

Canon is the foundational library for a useful type ecosystem. It serves as a canonical source of truth that solves common design problems and enables seamless composition for any project.

## Strategic Objectives

### 1. Solve the "Empty Room Problem"
**Problem**: How to establish a consistent set of initial design decisions across any project without unnecessary friction.

**Solution**: Provide a strong, canonical type system as the most useful tool for building robust, data-centric applications.

### 2. Universal Adapter Philosophy
**Vision**: Canon as a universal adapter that deliberately composes and re-exports a curated set of high-quality type primitives from the broader TypeScript ecosystem.

**Benefits**:
- Single, authoritative source for common types
- No need to manage a "laundry list" of dependencies
- Coherent toolkit assembled from the best available parts
- Universal code that works across diverse data structures

### 3. Multi-Format Data Handling
**Capability**: Support for multiple data formats (JSON-LD, MongoDB, REST APIs, GraphQL) through unified semantic concepts.

**Key Insight**: Multiple canons can exist at runtime, each representing different data formats, yet developers can program against a single, common API for semantic properties.

## Strategic Positioning

### Market Position
- **Primary**: TypeScript ecosystem foundational library
- **Secondary**: Universal data adapter for multi-format applications
- **Tertiary**: Semantic web and linked data integration

### Differentiation
1. **Axiomatic Approach**: Unique type system based on semantic concepts
2. **Lazy Typing**: Deferred type resolution with canonical identity preservation
3. **Format Agnostic**: Works across JSON-LD, MongoDB, REST APIs, GraphQL
4. **Composition-First**: Deliberate composition of best-in-class utilities

### Target Audience
1. **TypeScript Developers**: Building data-centric applications
2. **Full-Stack Teams**: Working with multiple data formats
3. **Semantic Web Developers**: JSON-LD and linked data applications
4. **Enterprise Teams**: Need consistent type systems across projects
