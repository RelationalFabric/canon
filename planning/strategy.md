# Canon Strategic Vision

## Mission Statement

Canon is the foundational library for a useful type ecosystem. It serves as a canonical source of truth that solves common design problems and enables seamless composition for any project.

## Current Reality Check

**As of January 2025, Canon is primarily a configuration package with extensive documentation but minimal core implementation:**

### ‚úÖ What's Actually Working
- **Configuration Package**: TypeScript and ESLint configurations
- **Development Tooling**: Build system, linting, ADR management
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples
- **Planning**: Strategy, roadmap, and technology radar
- **Basic Utility**: Exports `defu` for configuration merging

### ‚ùå What's Not Implemented Yet
- **Core Axiom System**: No axiom implementations in `src/`
- **Canon Patterns**: No canon implementations or type definitions
- **Utility Libraries**: No integration with type-fest, radash, etc.
- **Dual Export Strategy**: Documented but not implemented
- **Working Examples**: All examples are theoretical, not runnable

### üéØ Immediate Priority
**Phase 1 must focus on implementing the core type system before advancing to ecosystem features. The gap between documentation and implementation needs to be closed.**

## Strategic Objectives

### 1. Solve the "Empty Room Problem"
**Problem**: How to establish a consistent set of initial design decisions across any project without unnecessary friction.

**Solution**: Provide a strong, canonical type system as the most useful tool for building robust, data-centric applications.

### 2. Universal Adapter Philosophy
**Vision**: Canon as a universal adapter that deliberately composes and re-exports a curated set of high-quality type primitives from the broader TypeScript ecosystem.

**Benefits**:
- Single, authoritative source for common types
- No need to manage a "laundry list" of dependencies
- Coherent toolkit assembled from the best available parts
- Universal code that works across diverse data structures

### 3. Multi-Format Data Handling
**Capability**: Support for multiple data formats (JSON-LD, MongoDB, REST APIs, GraphQL) through unified semantic concepts.

**Key Insight**: Multiple canons can exist at runtime, each representing different data formats, yet developers can program against a single, common API for semantic properties.

## Strategic Positioning

### Market Position
- **Primary**: TypeScript ecosystem foundational library
- **Secondary**: Universal data adapter for multi-format applications
- **Tertiary**: Semantic web and linked data integration

### Differentiation
1. **Axiomatic Approach**: Unique type system based on semantic concepts
2. **Lazy Typing**: Deferred type resolution with canonical identity preservation
3. **Format Agnostic**: Works across JSON-LD, MongoDB, REST APIs, GraphQL
4. **Composition-First**: Deliberate composition of best-in-class utilities

### Target Audience
1. **TypeScript Developers**: Building data-centric applications
2. **Full-Stack Teams**: Working with multiple data formats
3. **Semantic Web Developers**: JSON-LD and linked data applications
4. **Enterprise Teams**: Need consistent type systems across projects

## Technology Strategy

### Core Technology Pillars

#### 1. Type System Innovation
- **Axioms**: Atomic building blocks for semantic concepts
- **Canons**: Universal type blueprints for data formats
- **Lazy Typing**: Runtime type inference with compile-time safety

#### 2. Ecosystem Curation

## Conclusion

Canon's strategic vision centers on becoming the foundational type system for the TypeScript ecosystem, solving the "empty room problem" through axiomatic design and universal data compatibility. Success will be measured not just by adoption, but by the quality of the ecosystem we enable and the problems we solve for developers building data-centric applications.

The key to achieving this vision is maintaining focus on our core strengths: type system innovation, ecosystem curation, and universal compatibility, while building a strong community of developers who share our vision of better type systems for better software.
