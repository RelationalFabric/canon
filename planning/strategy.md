# Canon Strategic Vision

## Mission Statement

Canon is the foundational library for a useful type ecosystem. It serves as a canonical source of truth that solves common design problems and enables seamless composition for any project.

## Current State

**What's working:**
- TypeScript/ESLint configs
- Documentation and planning
- Basic `defu` export

**What needs building:**
- Core axiom system
- Canon implementations  
- Utility library integration
- Working examples

## Goals

1. **Type system foundation** - Solve the "empty room problem" with consistent design decisions
2. **Universal adapter** - Curated utility library composition 
3. **Multi-format support** - JSON-LD, MongoDB, REST APIs through common API

## Positioning

**Target**: TypeScript developers building data-centric apps
**Differentiation**: Axiomatic type system with lazy typing and format agnostic design

## Tech Stack

**Core**: Axioms + Canons + Lazy Typing
**Utilities**: Curated libraries (type-fest, radash, etc.)
**Formats**: JSON-LD, MongoDB, REST, GraphQL

## Roadmap

**Phase 1**: Build core axiom/canon system
**Phase 2**: Add utility integrations  
**Phase 3**: Advanced features
**Phase 4**: Ecosystem leadership

*No timeline - work happens when possible*

## Success Metrics

- npm downloads and GitHub stars
- Zero runtime type errors
- Minimal bundle size impact
- Developer feedback
