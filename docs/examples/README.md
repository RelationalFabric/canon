# Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating how to use the @relational-fabric/canon package and its configurations.

## Available Examples

### [Deduplicating Entities](./deduplicating-entities.md)
Learn how to implement entity deduplication patterns using TypeScript and modern JavaScript features.

### [Tree Walk Over Mixed Entities](./tree-walk-over-mixed-entities.md)
Explore techniques for traversing heterogeneous data structures with type safety.

### [User Authentication Tokens](./user-authentication-tokens.md)
Implement secure token-based authentication patterns with proper TypeScript typing.

## Getting Started

Each example includes:
- **Complete code samples** with full TypeScript typing
- **Step-by-step explanations** of the implementation
- **Best practices** and common pitfalls to avoid
- **Integration examples** showing how to use with the canon configurations

## Prerequisites

Before running these examples, ensure you have:

- Node.js 22.0.0 or higher
- TypeScript 5.0.0 or higher
- ESLint 9.0.0 or higher

## Installation

```bash
npm install @relational-fabric/canon
```

## Usage

Each example can be run independently. Copy the code samples and adapt them to your specific use case. The examples are designed to work with the TypeScript and ESLint configurations provided by this package.

For more information about the package configurations, see the main [documentation](../README.md).
