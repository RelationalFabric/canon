# Technology Radar

Our comprehensive technology radar tracking recommendations for tools, techniques, features, and data formats used with Canon.

## Overview

The Canon Technology Radar provides a visual representation of our technology recommendations and assessments. It helps guide technology choices for Canon and its consumers by categorizing tools and techniques into four rings:

- **Adopt** - Strong recommendation. Proven, stable, and recommended for use.
- **Trial** - Evaluate for adoption. Worth exploring and evaluating for your context.
- **Assess** - Investigate further. Keep under review and assess for potential future use.
- **Hold** - Not recommended. Avoid or replace with better alternatives.

## Interactive Radar

The interactive radar visualization shows our current technology recommendations across four quadrants:

1. **Tools & Libraries** - Third-party libraries, build tools, and development utilities
2. **Techniques & Patterns** - Architectural patterns, development practices, and type system techniques
3. **Features & Capabilities** - Runtime features, development features, and integration capabilities
4. **Data Structures, Formats & Standards** - Data structures, serialization formats, identity standards, and schema standards

## Methodology

Our radar methodology is documented in the [Radar Methodology](../../radar-methodology.md) guide, which explains:

- How we evaluate technologies
- Our assessment criteria
- The review and update process
- How to contribute to radar decisions

## Data Sources

The radar data is maintained in structured formats:

- **YAML Format**: [../../radar/data.yaml](../../radar/data.yaml) - Human-editable source data
- **CSV Format**: [../../radar/data.csv](../../radar/data.csv) - Generated format for build-your-own-radar tool
- **Configuration**: [../../radar/config.yaml](../../radar/config.yaml) - Radar configuration and metadata

## Contributing

Technology recommendations are reviewed and updated regularly. To suggest changes:

1. Review the [Contributing Guidelines](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Open an issue or pull request with your recommendation
3. Provide rationale based on our assessment criteria
4. Include evidence of evaluation and testing
