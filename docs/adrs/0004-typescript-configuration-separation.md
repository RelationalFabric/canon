# ADR-004: TypeScript Configuration Separation

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2025-01-26

## Context and Problem Statement

The TypeScript configuration was initially contained in a single `tsconfig.json` file. To make the package more useful for consumers and allow for better configuration management, we needed to separate the configuration into a base configuration that could be shared and a project-specific configuration.

## Decision Drivers

* Need to provide reusable TypeScript configuration for consumers
* Desire to separate shared configuration from project-specific settings
* Requirement for easy consumption by other packages
* Need to maintain consistency across related projects
* Desire to reduce configuration duplication
* Need for clear separation of concerns

## Considered Options

* Keep single tsconfig.json file
* Create separate base configuration file
* Use multiple configuration files with different purposes
* Create configuration package as separate npm package

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Create separate base configuration file", because it provides a clean separation between shared and project-specific configuration while keeping everything in the same package.

### Positive Consequences

* Consumers can easily extend the base configuration
* Clear separation between shared and project-specific settings
* Base configuration can be exported and reused
* Easier maintenance of configuration
* Follows common patterns in TypeScript packages
* Reduces configuration duplication across projects

### Negative Consequences

* Slightly more complex file structure
* Need to maintain two configuration files
* Consumers need to understand the separation

## Implementation Details

* **Base configuration**: `tsconfig.base.json` with shared settings
* **Project configuration**: `tsconfig.json` extends base and adds project-specific settings
* **Package exports**: `"./tsconfig": "./tsconfig.base.json"`
* **Files included**: `tsconfig.base.json` in package files
* **Base settings**: Modern TypeScript features, Node.js LTS compatibility, declarations, source maps
* **Project settings**: Source directory, output directory, include/exclude patterns

## Usage Examples

**For consumers:**
```json
{
  "extends": "@relational-fabric/canon/tsconfig"
}
```

**For the package:**
```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
}
```
