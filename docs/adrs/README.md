# Architecture Decision Records

This section contains all Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the @relational-fabric/canon package.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a project. They provide context for why decisions were made and help future contributors understand the reasoning behind the current architecture.
