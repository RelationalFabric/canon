# Canon Documentation

Welcome to the Canon documentation. This directory contains comprehensive guides for understanding and using the Canon type system.

## Table of Contents

- [Canons](./canons.md) - Understanding Canon types and their implementation
- [Axioms](./axioms.md) - Deep dive into axiomatic primitives and their role in the type system
- [Reference Axioms](../reference/axioms.md) - The essential set of axioms that form the foundation of Canon
- [Examples](./examples/) - Comprehensive examples of core axioms in practice

## Quick Start

Canon is a foundational library for building robust type ecosystems. It provides:

1. **Universal Type Primitives** - A curated set of battle-tested types from the TypeScript ecosystem
2. **Canonical Type Definitions** - Consistent, reusable type blueprints
3. **Axiomatic System** - Rich configuration system for defining data models
4. **Lazy Typing** - Deferred type resolution with canonical identity preservation

For detailed usage examples and implementation guides, explore the individual documentation files above.
