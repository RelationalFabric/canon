# Canon Technology Radar Methodology

This document describes how we maintain and update the Canon Technology Radar, including our decision-making process, review cycles, and governance.

## Overview

The Canon Technology Radar is a living document that tracks our recommendations for tools, techniques, features, and data formats. It helps consumers understand what technologies to adopt, trial, assess, or avoid when building with Canon.

## Radar Structure

### Quadrants

1. **Tools & Libraries** - Third-party libraries, build tools, and development utilities
2. **Techniques & Patterns** - Architectural patterns, development practices, and type system techniques
3. **Features & Capabilities** - Runtime features, development features, and integration capabilities
4. **Data Structures, Formats & Standards** - Data structures, serialization formats, identity standards, and schema standards

### Rings

- **Adopt** - Strong recommendation. Proven, stable, and recommended for use
- **Trial** - Evaluate for adoption. Worth exploring and evaluating for your context
- **Assess** - Investigate further. Keep under review and assess for potential future use
- **Hold** - Not recommended. Avoid or replace with better alternatives

## Decision Criteria

### Adopt
- Proven track record in production
- Strong community support and maintenance
- Aligns with Canon's philosophy and goals
- Provides clear value to consumers
- Has been successfully used in Canon development

### Trial
- Shows promise but needs evaluation
- Addresses specific needs not met by current tools
- Has good TypeScript support (for libraries)
- Reasonable bundle size impact
- Active maintenance and community

### Assess
- Interesting but unproven
- May address future needs
- Requires further investigation
- Potential risks or limitations need evaluation

### Hold
- Proven to be problematic
- Superseded by better alternatives
- Doesn't align with Canon's direction
- High maintenance burden or complexity

## Update Process

### Regular Reviews

**Quarterly Reviews** (every 3 months)
- Review all Trial entries for promotion/demotion
- Evaluate Assess entries for potential promotion
- Check Adopt entries for any issues or deprecations
- Update justifications based on new information

**Annual Reviews** (every 12 months)
- Comprehensive review of entire radar
- Strategic alignment with Canon's roadmap
- Major technology trend evaluation
- Archive outdated entries

### Ad-Hoc Updates

**Immediate Updates**
- Security vulnerabilities in Adopt entries
- Breaking changes in critical dependencies
- New technologies that significantly impact Canon's mission

**Monthly Updates**
- New library evaluations
- Community feedback integration
- Performance or compatibility issues

## Governance

### Decision Makers

- **Canon Maintainers** - Final authority on radar entries
- **Community Contributors** - Input and proposals
- **Consumer Feedback** - Real-world usage experiences

### Decision Process

1. **Proposal** - New entry or change request
2. **Discussion** - Community input and maintainer review
3. **Evaluation** - Testing and assessment period
4. **Decision** - ADR-style documentation of rationale
5. **Implementation** - Update radar data and documentation

## Data Management

### File Structure

```
radar/
├── data.yaml          # Human-editable radar data
├── data.csv           # Generated CSV for visualization tools
├── config.yaml        # Radar configuration and metadata
├── scripts/           # Conversion and management tools
└── README.md          # Radar directory documentation
```

### Workflow

1. **Edit** - Modify `data.yaml` with new entries or changes
2. **Convert** - Run `npm run radar:convert` to generate CSV
3. **Review** - Validate changes before committing
4. **Commit** - Version control both YAML and CSV files
5. **Visualize** - Use generated CSV with build-your-own-radar tool

### Automation

- **Watch Mode** - `npm run radar:watch` for automatic CSV regeneration
- **Validation** - Scripts to validate data structure and completeness
- **CI Integration** - Automated testing of radar data format

## Integration with ADRs

The radar methodology integrates with our Architecture Decision Record (ADR) process:

- **ADR-010** - Technology Radar Implementation
- **ADR-011** - Radar Data Format and Management
- **ADR-012** - Radar Governance and Update Process

Each major radar decision should be documented as an ADR, including:
- Context and problem statement
- Decision drivers and criteria
- Considered options
- Decision outcome and consequences
- Implementation details

## Quality Assurance

### Data Validation

- **Structure Validation** - Ensure proper YAML structure and required fields
- **Content Validation** - Check for completeness and consistency
- **Link Validation** - Verify external references and documentation
- **Format Validation** - Ensure CSV generation works correctly

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Entry has clear, concise description
- [ ] Justification aligns with Canon's philosophy
- [ ] Ring placement is appropriate
- [ ] Quadrant categorization is correct
- [ ] New entries are marked appropriately
- [ ] Links and references are valid

## Communication

### Internal Communication

- **Maintainer Discussions** - Regular sync on radar direction
- **Community Input** - GitHub issues and discussions
- **Consumer Feedback** - Usage patterns and pain points

### External Communication

- **Documentation** - Clear explanations in radar entries
- **Blog Posts** - Major radar updates and rationale
- **Conference Talks** - Sharing methodology and insights
- **Community Engagement** - Responding to questions and feedback

## Metrics and Success

### Key Metrics

- **Adoption Rate** - How often Adopt entries are used
- **Trial Success** - Promotion rate from Trial to Adopt
- **Consumer Satisfaction** - Feedback on radar usefulness
- **Update Frequency** - Regular maintenance and freshness

### Success Criteria

- Radar entries are actively used by consumers
- Regular updates maintain relevance
- Clear guidance helps with technology decisions
- Community actively contributes to radar evolution

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

- **Automated Updates** - Integration with package vulnerability databases
- **Usage Analytics** - Track which radar entries are most referenced
- **Interactive Visualization** - Enhanced radar visualization tools
- **API Integration** - Programmatic access to radar data

### Scalability

- **Entry Limits** - Guidelines for managing radar size
- **Categorization** - Refinement of quadrants as Canon evolves
- **Automation** - Increased automation for routine updates
- **Governance** - Scaling decision-making processes
